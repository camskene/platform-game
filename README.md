# Platform Game

Simple platform game created by completing the HTML5 Games Workshop at Mozilla:

Lots of fun getting started with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), highly recommend checking out the above workshop!

## Development

#### Install Browser Sync to run a local server:

`npm -g install browser-sync`

`cd` into the project directory and then:

`browser-sync start --server --files="**/*.js"`

This will launch a server on port `3000` and reload the browser whenever a JavaScript file is modified.
